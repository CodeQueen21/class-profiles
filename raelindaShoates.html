          <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Raelinda and I love creating web pages. I first discovered web development through Amazon career choice in 2019-2020 however I really struggled in that class. I earned my certification but I was still lost so I took the next few years to study web development on my own and then I decided to join this class. I want to make a career out of this!</p>
